# Advanced evaluation dependencies for NOMAD Path Planning Evaluation
# =====================================================================
# 
# These are OPTIONAL heavyweight dependencies used ONLY by planning_eval.py
# for specialized trajectory and path planning evaluation.
#
# WHEN TO INSTALL:
# - You want to evaluate NOMAD path planning quality
# - You need trajectory analysis with APE/RPE metrics
# - You are working with navigation and pose estimation evaluation
#
# WHEN NOT NEEDED:
# - You only need image generation evaluation (use inferEval.py instead)
# - You are only training or inference without detailed planning analysis
#
# INSTALLATION:
# pip install -r requirements-eval.txt
# OR
# python scripts/worldmem_setup_and_test.py
#
# SIZE WARNING: These packages are ~100MB+ due to ROS support and specialized models

# Trajectory evaluation library (heavyweight - includes ROS support, etc.)
evo>=1.12.0

# Advanced similarity metrics (requires special models)
